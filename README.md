Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN in PyTorch

This repository contains code for a handwritten digit recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in PyTorch. The system is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The CNN achieves an accuracy of 90% on the test set.
